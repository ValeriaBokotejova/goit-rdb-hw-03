## ðŸ“š SQL Practice - Basic Queries

This project contains basic SQL queries for working with a database:

- Selecting data with `SELECT`
- Using aggregate functions like `AVG()`, `MAX()`, `MIN()`
- Selecting distinct values
- Sorting and limiting results
- Counting records within a range
- Grouping data with `GROUP BY`

The queries were executed and tested in **MySQL Workbench** on the `mydb` database.
